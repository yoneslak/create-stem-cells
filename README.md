In this scenario, synthetic data is created from a stem cell.
This data consists of gene expression, morphology, and cell stimulation levels at different times.
An artificial stem cell is created.
This cell can be used in areas such as:
It can be used for differential gene expression, diagnosis of rare diseases, pharmaceuticals, personal doctors, and the like.
